# Uber: Accurate ETA Predictions using DeepETA serving Uber's Businesses 

For many years, Uber's ETA prediction algorithms were based on gradient-boosted decision tree ensembles. As the training data and models grew subsequently with each release, maintaining the model became difficult. Deep Learning techniques were being studied because they allowed for large datasets processing using data-parallel distributed training paradigms.
